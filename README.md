# Real-time-human-locating-and-identifying-by-Kinect
In the era of ubiquitous computing, physical space is becoming more and more intelligent. Real-time human locating and identifying is the fundamental element of smart service in intelligent space. The goal of this project is to build an indoor human tracking system, which could locate people in group and recognize their identity. There are 3 main innovation points:

First, presenting an indoor locating method based on the data fusion of multi-depth sensors, which shows high precision and good robustness. The human tracking method is based on random forest decision and depth image background difference algorithm. The locating error is less than 10cm and the computing time is less than 50ms.

Second, realizing a human identification method based on the feature of human body. The system extracts body information like human face, body height and the color of user’s clothes to achieve quick and robust identifying result. The accuracy reaches 75% and the delaying time is less than 50ms. 

Third, build a prototype of the system. The system is working with multi-Kinect so that it can cover larger space. To analysis the performance of the system, a project is built in the lab in Room B429，Lee ShauKee Building in Tsinghua University. The system uses 3 Kinect to cover a 4m×4m×3m area. The average locating error is 6.48 cm with 20FPS updating rate, and the ID recognizing accuracy reaches 75%.

The indoor human locating and identity recognizing method presented in this thesis and its prototype system, which is based on the data fusion of multiple depth sensors, show high accuracy and good robustness. The study lays a solid foundation for further computing service in smart space.
